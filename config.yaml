    subtitle: "My experience during my undergraduate studies and as an analyst has broadened my knowledge in terms of business and people skills. \n 
    Through my work in one of the fastest-growing AI and analytics startups in India, 
    I believe my cross-functional work experiences working for clients from across the globe have helped me build on my management and strategic skills. \n 
    During my time at TheMathCompany, working directly with clients to handle their day-to-day triggers and optimizing their existing models gave me a deeper 
    understanding of multiple fields under marketing and customer acquisition. \n 
    I believe my experiences in a start-up will be my key contributors in this everchanging entrepreneurial world. \n 
    My ability to get into any role during the need of the hour has made me more open-minded and helped me understand how to make the best of an opportunity. \n 
    I aim to bring this go-getter attitude, entrepreneurial spirit to the program and also wish to 
    learn from the experiences of my peers. "
