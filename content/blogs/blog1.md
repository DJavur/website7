I’m Disha Javur, a Master’s in Analytics and Management student at LBS. I was raised in the hustling and bustling city of Mumbai. I have lived there for more than 15 years and I call it my home. 

I have had a very holistic upbringing with due diligence paid to both academics and extracurricular activities. I was encouraged to have a curious mind and to set my standards high. Sports has always been an integral aspect of my life, teaching me the importance of teamwork and discipline. Over time, I realized that these principles are also reflected in daily life. By utilizing these insights, I have fostered a spirit of excellence, giving my best to everything I do. I have been trained in several sports including : 

1. Swimming
2. Tennis 
3. Table tennis
4. Badminton 
5. Handball

In addition, I enjoy adventure sports as well and have done river-rafting, trekking, surfing, and paragliding. Even during my undergrad, I was part of several clubs. Through these various endeavours, I have developed a strong sense of team-building and interpersonal skills. Apart from sports, I like to read and draw. I’ve read more than a 1000 books and I truly believe everyone should have a habit of reading as its a great way to help us to hone our imaginative skills. 

After high school, I took up engineering and have a degree in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, India. Going to an engineering college taught me a lot and helped me grow personally and professionally. Post college, I worked as an analyst for one of the fastest AI and analytics start-ups in India. Here, I worked on several different projects, including one in which I worked directly with the clients of a multibillion-dollar corporation, giving me the confidence to work with people of varying levels of experience and the ability to comprehend business from a technical standpoint. 

Working as a data analyst made me realise the vast scope in the analytics field and its impact on the world and thus I chose to pursue a career in this field at LBS. I’m hoping for this year to be transformative and an unforgettable one.
